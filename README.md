# PHP-Restaurant

This project is for the 2nd year of my Bachelor, in Computer Science, for the course of Web Application Development.
It covers the basics of a full stack web application developer.

# Project's Description

This project is a web application of a restaurant and it's main goal is to serve the guests of the page. Here the guests can see the location of the restaurant from google maps, some pictures of the facilities, the menu and make reservations any time they want. The guests also will be able to register in order to track their reservation history.
in case, the person who logged in, is one of the administrators then the page will show an additional button of the control panel which will take this administrator in the control panel, from where will be able to add new members or delete, make reservations or delete them, change the times in which the restaurant takes reservations and of course change an existing menu or add a new one.
